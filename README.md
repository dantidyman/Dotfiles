## Dotfiles for Daniel

This is a basic file for dotfiles for me. I'm working on actually teaching myself the proper way to handle this, so bear with me.

## Installation
`git clone` this repo to your Home, and then run `source config.sh` to begin installing.

## Bugs
Please report any bugs or suggestions. I'm new to scripting and dotfiles, so suggestions are welcome.
